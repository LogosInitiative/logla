Logos
=====

The Logos project can be though of a as an organizational fork of the TLI and the LLG and their respective Loglan and Lojban languages. The purpose of the Logos project is to reconcile the differences between these two languages, to create a new hybrid language called *Logla Prime*, and then mangage the natural never ending process of evolution of this language. The overarching goal of the Logos is to continue the original, if only implicit, mission set out by the the two prior projects: the coninuing perfection of human language.

Unlike TLI and Loglan, the Logos project is 100% open source, all material is copyleft, and anyone can participate in development of the language --the Logla. Unlike Lojban, Logla is a living changing language. Dialects (variant Logla) are warmly welcomed. The best features of dialects may find there way to the mainline language (Logla Prime). Changes to the mainline language are decided by long and rigorous debate, and finally unanomous concensus between the supervisory chairs.

Github project management tools will play an important part in the language deveopment. The issue tracker will be used to propose and debate ideas. And the Github's wiki will be used to write up detailed formal proposals as needed.

As the language evolves, infrequent but periodic baselines will be established. These will be considered complete dialects of the language and given specific names. These baselines can then evolve on their own if enough people are invested in them. And these differnet baselines can cross-pollinate with the mainline and one another, perhaps ulitmately to create a healthy conservatory of interbreeding logical langauge.


## Principles

1. Strive for perfection in human communication.
2. Seek greater simplicty to ease learning and promote productive usage.
3. Use common patterns within the language's design wherever possible.
4. Seek concision without complexity. 


## Current Goals

1. Optimize the phonology.
2. Simplify the morphology.
3. Build a unified vocabulary.

See the wiki page for a more detailed list.


## Status

Currently the Logla consists of two widely divergent dialects: the original Loglan and its rebel progeny Lojban. Hence much of the initial activity will center around reconciling these two into a single mainline language. Every aspect of this process will be put under the microscope and in some cases the result may be unlike either of the two source languages, should they both prove deficient in some specific area.

Running parallel to this reconciliation, the floor is open to all new ideas. There is nothing too radical or too minor that it should not be given due consideration. 


## History

James Cooke Brown began work on Loglan in 1955, originally devised to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. In 1960 Scientific American published an article introducing the language which popularized his work. The Loglan Institute (TLI) was founded some years later to develop the language and other applications for it. JCB always considered the language an incomplete research project, and although he released many papers about its design, he continued to claim legal restrictions on its use. 

In the 1980s disputes broke out over control of the language. Bob LeChevalier and a group of fellow Loglanists formed the Logical Language Group (LLG) to create a new language called Lojban along the same basic design principles, but with the intention to make it more widely available and encourage its use as a real language.

TLI has been true to its charter and has continued to evolve, albeit slowly. It remains however, squarly in the hands of academia.

The LLG on the other hand has moved in another direction. The Logical Language Group's Bylaws states its purpose as follows:

> The Logical Language Group, Inc. is established to promote the scientific study of the relationships between language, thought and human culture; to investigate the nature of language and to determine the requirements for an artificially-engineered natural language; to implement and experiment with such a language; to devise and promote applications for this language in fields including but not limited to linguistics, psychology, philosophy, logic, mathematics, computer science, anthropology, sociology, education, and human biology; to conduct and support experimental and scholarly research in these fields as they may bear upon the problems of artificial language development; to communicate with and to educate interested persons and organizations about these activities; to devise and develop means and instruments needed for these activities; and to accumulate and publish the results of such studies and developments. In the furtherance of these purposes, and in addition to the above activities, 

With such purpose one could be forgiven for expecting the Lojban language to hotbed of language experimentation and exploration. Ironically nothing could be further from the truth. Lojban was *baselined* in 1997 for a period of five years. But the baseline has since become a defacto freeze. While still giving lip service to proposals, the language is no longer evolving. Put simply, the LLG's purpose has changed. It now exists "to preserve the investment people have made in learning the language".

So on the one hand we have a sequestered research language unaccessable to the populus at large, and on the other a language no longer allowed to evolve. This is the reason the Logos project has been created.
