Logos
=====

Logos is a project to fork the Loglan and Lojban languages, reconcile there differences and then mangage a natural never ending process of evolution. It's primary goal is to continue the original mission set out by both projects: the perfection of human language.

Unlike Loglan, the Logos project is 100% open source, all material is copyleft, and anyone can participate.

Unlike Lojban, Logla is a living changing language. Dialects are warmly welcome. The best features of dialects may find there way to the mainline language. Changes to the mainline language are decided by long and rigorous debate.

The Github issues tracker will be used to propose and debate ideas. And the Github's wiki will be used to write up detailed formal proposals as needed.

As the language evolves, infrequent but periodic baselines will be established. These will be considered complete dialects of the language and given specific names. These baselines can then evolve on their own if enough people are attached to them. And these differnet baselines can cross-pollinate with the mainline and one another, to ulitmately create a full conservatory of interbreeding logical langauges.


## Goals

1. Strive for perfection in human communication. This is the overarching goal from which all other eminate.
2. Seek greater simplicty to ease learning and promote productive usage. Coorelary to this goal is to use common patterns within the language's design wherever possible.
3. Seek concision without complexity. 


## Status

Currently Logla consists of two widely divergent dialects: the original Loglan and its rebel progeny Lojban. Hence much of the initial activity will center around reconciling these two into a single mainline language. Every aspect of this process will be put under the microscope and in some cases the result may not be like either of the two source languages, should it is decided they are both deficient in some specific area.

Running parallel to this reconciliation, the floor is open to all new ideas. There is nothing too radical or too minor that it should not be given due consideration. 


## History

James Cooke Brown began work on Loglan in 1955, originally devised to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

The Loglan Institute ...

In the ... a dispute broke out over control of the language.

The Logical Language Group's Bylaws states its purpose as follows:

> The Logical Language Group, Inc. is established to promote the scientific study of the relationships between language, thought and human culture; to investigate the nature of language and to determine the requirements for an artificially-engineered natural language; to implement and experiment with such a language; to devise and promote applications for this language in fields including but not limited to linguistics, psychology, philosophy, logic, mathematics, computer science, anthropology, sociology, education, and human biology; to conduct and support experimental and scholarly research in these fields as they may bear upon the problems of artificial language development; to communicate with and to educate interested persons and organizations about these activities; to devise and develop means and instruments needed for these activities; and to accumulate and publish the results of such studies and developments. In the furtherance of these purposes, and in addition to the above activities, 

With such a purpose one could be forgiven for expecting the Lojban language to hotbed of language experimentation and exploration. Ironically nothing could be further from the truth. Lojban was *baselined* in 1997 for a period of five years. But the baseline has since become a defacto freeze. While still giving lip service to proposals, the language is no longer evolving. Put simply, the LLG's purpose has changed. They now exist "to preserve the investment people have made in learning the language".
