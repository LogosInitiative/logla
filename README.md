Logla
=====

## Phonology

Phonology is almost identical to Loglan and Lojban with only a few exceptions.

First, it has not yet been decided, but two new constants might be added corresponding to the `th` in English `thank` and `this`. If not that `f` and `v` will gain these sounds as acceptable pronunciations.

2. `h` is written as a letter, not as an apostrophe.
3. `'` is used to mark a stop instead of `.`.


## Morphology

Logla has the same basic morphology as Loglan and Lojban. But Logla avoids the extraneous complexities that Loglan and Lojban. 

The most basic difference is that Logla allows double constants, for example `fimma`. To distinguish these words without ambiguity the pronunciation of the double constant must be held for a period perceptably longer than noramal --typically double the length of a single constant. Alternately, the constant can be asperated. So `fimma` would sound like <tt>fim<sup>h</sup>a</tt>.

Gisma are always in the form of `CVCCa` or `CCVCa`. Likewise three-syllable *lujva* are always `CVCCVCCa`, `CCVCVCCa`, `CVCCCVCa` or `CCVCCVCa`. The same pattern continues for four or more syllables (which are of course exceedingly rare and generally exist only to address techincal terms). Unlike Loglan and Lojban there is no `y` (schwa) hyphen. Nor are there any rafsi. Instead lujvo are formed very simply by taking the first three letters of the first gismu and combining it with the entire second gismu. For example, `bitma` and `salfa` would form `bitsalfa`. If the combined form happens to already be an offical word in the Logla dictionary, utlizing the first three letters of different word (for example `bitca`), then a *proper lujva* would be formed by combine the two words in there enitity instering a andditional constant between them. For example `bitmarsalfa`. The constant choosen is essentially arbitrary, but it should have either a ... significance, or taken from the following key. The first letter in the pair is the new letter, and the second is the first letter of the gisma it would preceed.

    b  tc  d  f  g  dj  sk  l  m  n  p  q  r  s  t  v  x  z
   
Using this map has the advantage of creating a constanal redundancy, which makes it easier for listener to parse these long words.

Note that *borrowed* lujva will not necessarily have a semantic deconstructions. For example `balkonni`, meaning "balcony", does not mean a balanced cone. Most words will desconstruct nicely, just not all.


## Vocabulary

### Cmava

Cmava will get a heavy make over, both to reconcile differences between Loglan and Lojban, but also to imporove on both. The primary goal is to utilize common patterns wherever possible and reduce the number of necessary words. For example cmava that create subordinate clauses will either use a redundant closing phonome, e.g. `lu ... ka lu` or a standard set of bracket words, e.g. `so lu ... sa`. Perhaps both forms will be supported.

We will also consdier allowing cmavo in `cvvv` form where the second to last vowel is either `i` or `u`. This more than doubles the available cmavo space.


### Gisma



## Grammar

You may have already noticed somthing is up with the last letter or gisma. They're all `a`! The reason is simple. The last letter of any word indicates the predicate slot within the word that is intended. So for example the Lojban word for come/go/travel is `klama`. Hence a `klama` is a travaller, a `klame` is a destination of travel, `klami` is an origin of travel, `klamo` is the route travelled, and a `klamu` is the means of travel.
